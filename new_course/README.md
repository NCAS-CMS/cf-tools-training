# New course

**Note: this new course is being trialled and therefore may change after feedback, but should be
self-contained and sufficient to work through as-is in its current form.**

### Setup

In the form of Jupyter Notebooks. At present the course only contains the introduction/summary
content but extension modules will be added to cover certain topics in depth and to show the
libraries in real practical use cases.

Consisting of (at present - to be extended):

* introduction module:
  * a teaching Notebook `intro_to_ncas_cf_data_tools.ipynb`
    of introduction, setup and six sections, designed to be lectured as a taught
    walkthrough interleaved with the corresponding practical sessions from the practical
    Notebook below after every 2-3 sections are taught, overall taking around 45 minutes to teach
    (but can also be followed along with independently)
  * a practical Notebook `practical_for_intro_to_ncas_cf_data_tools.ipynb`  with
     introductory context and reminders then six sections of practical questions with solved answers
     for the sections matching the teaching Notebook, designed to be worked through after the
     corresponding taught sections are presented from the above teaching
     Notebook but can also be worked through independently)


### Setup

As a computing environment requires (at least):

* service or server capable of running Jupyter Notebook, locally or hosted at location of choice
  which could be externally or in-browser;
* cf-python v. 3.16.2 or higher;
* cf-plot v. 3.3.0 or higher;
* Python v.3.8.0., the minimum Python version that is compatible with the above cf* minimum versions.
