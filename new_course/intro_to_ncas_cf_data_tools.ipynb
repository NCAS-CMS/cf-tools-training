    "\n",
    "**What are the NCAS CF Data Tools and why do they all have 'cf' in the name?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The NCAS CF Data Tools are a suite of Python libraries which are designed to facilitate working with data for research in the earth sciences and aligned domains. The two that are of most relevance to the average user, and those wanting to process, analyse and visualise atmospheric data, are cf-python (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/) and cf-plot (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-plot/build/). We will be focusing on use of cf-python and cf-plot today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'cf' in the names of the NCAS CF Data Tools corresponds to the CF Conventions, a metadata standard, because they are built around this standard in the form of using the CF Data Model, which as well as performance is considered a 'unique selling point' of the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the CF Conventions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CF Conventions are a metadata standard which is becoming the de-facto convention across geoscience to cover the description of data so that sharing and intercomparison is simpler. See https://cfconventions.org/ for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are we going to learn in this session?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our learning aim is to be able to use the NCAS CF Data Tools Python libraries, namely cf-python and cf-plot to process, analyse and visualise netCDF and PP datasets, whilst appreciating the context and 'unique selling point' of the libraries as being built to use the CF Conventions, a metadata standard for earth science data, to make it simpler to do what you want to do with the datasets, by working on top of a Data Model for CF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have six distinct objectives, matching the sections in this notebook (except one section we split into two so we can introduce plotting earlier on). By the end of this lesson you should be familiar and have practiced:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using cf-python to read dataset(s) and view the (meta)data at different detail levels;\n",
    "* Using cf-python to edit the data and write out the edited data to file;\n",
    "* Reducing datasets using cf-python: subspacing and collapsing (part 1, basic, and part 2, more advanced);\n",
    "* Visualising datasets using cf-plot: contour and vector plots;\n",
    "* Data analysis using cf-python and cf-plot: arithmetic, statistics and plots of trends;\n",
    "* Changing the underlying grid of data using cf-python: regridding.\n"
