    "## Context and learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the NCAS CF Data Tools and why do they all have 'cf' in the name?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _NCAS CF Data Tools_ are a suite of complementary Python libraries which are designed to facilitate working with data for research in the earth sciences and aligned domains. The two that are of most relevance to the average user, and those wanting to process, analyse and visualise atmospheric data, are *cf-python* (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/) and *cf-plot* (https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-plot/build/). We will be focusing on use of cf-python and cf-plot today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'cf' in the names of the NCAS CF Data Tools corresponds to the _CF Conventions_, a metadata standard, because they are built around this standard in the form of using the CF Data Model, which as well as performance is considered a 'unique selling point' of the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the CF Conventions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _CF Conventions_, usually referred to in this way but also know by the full name of the **C**limate and **F**orecast (CF) metadata conventions, are a metadata standard which is becoming the de-facto convention to cover the description of geoscientific data so that sharing and intercomparison is simpler. See https://cfconventions.org/ for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we going to learn in this session?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **learning aim** is to be able to use the NCAS CF Data Tools Python libraries, namely cf-python and cf-plot to process, analyse and visualise netCDF and PP datasets, whilst appreciating the context and 'unique selling point' of the libraries as being built to use the CF Conventions, a metadata standard for earth science data, to make it simpler to do what you want to do with the datasets, by working on top of a Data Model for CF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have **six distinct objectives**, matching the sections in this notebook and in the practical notebook you will work through. By the end of this lesson you should be familiar and have practiced using cf-python and cf-plot to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read dataset(s) and view the (meta)data at different detail levels;\n",
    "2. edit the (meta)data and write out the edited version to file;\n",
    "3. reduce datasets by subspacing and collapsing;\n",
    "4. visualise datasets as contour and vector plots;\n",
    "5. analyse data: applying mathematical and statistical operations and plotting trends;\n",
    "6. change the underlying grid of data through regridding."

    "<i>Note:</i> much of what you can do with cf-python you can do with the xarray library. Use whichever approach, the cf-python/cf-plot way, or the xarray way, works best for you! However, we want to emphasise that the NCAS CF Data Tools are built around the CF Conventions whereas xarray is not, so cf-python and cf-plot offer better metadata awareness to xarray, which could be a core advantage to our approach for users in/from geoscience. (If you have suggestions for how we can improve cf-python and/or cf-plot for you or your work, please let us know through the Issue Trackers linked at the end of this Notebook.)\n",
